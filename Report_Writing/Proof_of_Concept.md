# Proof of Concept

## Overview
Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the existence and exploitability of a vulnerability. It provides evidence that the vulnerability can be exploited.

## Components
- **Exploit Code**
  - Example payload or script
- **Demonstration**
  - Steps to reproduce the exploit

## Example
Proof of Concept for an SQL Injection:
```plaintext
1. Access the vulnerable URL: http://example.com/products?id=1' OR '1'='1
2. Observe the response with unauthorized data.
