# Post Exploitation

## Overview
Post exploitation involves activities performed after gaining access to a system. This includes maintaining access, gathering additional information, and cleaning up traces.

## Techniques
- **Privilege Escalation** - Gaining higher-level access on the compromised system.
- **Data Exfiltration** - Extracting sensitive information from the compromised system.

## Tools
- **Mimikatz** - A tool for extracting credentials and performing other post-exploitation tasks.
- **Empire** - A post-exploitation framework for PowerShell.

## Example
Using `Mimikatz` for credential extraction:
```bash
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::logonpasswords
