# Static Analysis

## Overview
Static analysis involves examining the source code or binary of an Android application without executing it. This helps identify security vulnerabilities, coding issues, and potential exploits.

## Techniques
- **Code Review** - Manually reviewing source code for vulnerabilities.
- **Automated Tools** - Using tools like `MobSF` to analyze code for security issues.

## Example
Using `MobSF` for static analysis:
```bash
mobsf -i myapp.apk
