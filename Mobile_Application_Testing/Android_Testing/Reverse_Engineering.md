## Overview
Reverse engineering involves deconstructing an Android application to understand its functionality and uncover vulnerabilities. This can be done using tools and techniques to analyze APK files.

- **Binary Analysis** - Examining the binary code of an application.

## Example
Decompiling an APK with `Jadx`:
```bash
jadx -d output_directory myapp.apk
