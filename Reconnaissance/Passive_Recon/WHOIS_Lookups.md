# WHOIS Lookups

## Overview
WHOIS lookups provide information about the ownership and registration details of domain names. This can be useful for identifying the owners of a domain, finding related domains, or gathering information for further reconnaissance.

## Techniques
- **WHOIS Lookup Services** - Websites or tools that provide WHOIS information (e.g., `whois.domaintools.com`, `whois.net`).
- **Command Line Tools** - Use tools like `whois` on Unix-based systems.

## Example
Performing a WHOIS lookup for `example.com`:
```bash
whois example.com
